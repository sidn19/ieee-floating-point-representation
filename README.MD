# IEEE Floating Point Representation
An electron built desktop application that performs IEEE floating point multiplication.
It takes two inputs multiplicand and multiplier from the user as decimal numbers and converts it into binary format, then calculates the biased exponent and displays the numbers in IEEE format. It then calculates the signed bit, biased exponent and mantissa. Then finally displays the result in binary and decimal format.
